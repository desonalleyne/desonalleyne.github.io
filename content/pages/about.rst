Hello world. My name is Deson Alleyne. I'm a Software Developer living in Georgetown, Guyana. I studied Computer Science at the University of Guyana and earned my degree there. 

Since graduating, I've been converting business requirements into applications in the telecoms industry, designing, developing, maintaining and supporting high-traffic applications and services used by thousands daily, and building APIs to bridge the gap between applications.

When I'm not working, you might find me converting the light switches in my home to smart switches using arduino, or learning the F scale on my Yamaha PSR-79 musical keyboard.
