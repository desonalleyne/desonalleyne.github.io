Hello world. My name is Deson Alleyne. I'm a Software Developer living in Georgetown, Guyana. 

After studying Computer Science at the University of Guyana I worked in the telecoms industry converting business requirements into applications. I gained experience designing, developing, maintaining and supporting high-traffic applications and services used by thousands of customers daily, and built APIs to allow communication between applications.

I shifted to the fintech space two years ago and today I am System Administrator at Mobile Money Guyana, Guyana's premier mobile financial system. There, I lead the technical team and oversee the development of new features in the platform.

When I'm not working, you might find me converting the light switches in my home to smart switches using arduino, learning the F scale on my Yamaha PSR-79 musical keyboard or operating my CNC machine while my self-watering gardern waters itself.
